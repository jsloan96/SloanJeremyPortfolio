										In the Machine Learning terminology, the process of Classification can be defined as a supervised learning algorithm that aims at categorizing 
										a set of data into different classes. In other words, if we think of a data set as a set of data instances, and each data instance as a set of features, 
										then Classification is the process of predicting the particular class that that individual data instance might belong to, based on its features.
										There are many applications in classification in many domains such as in credit approval, medical diagnosis, target marketing etc.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem. This is s binary classification since there are 
										only 2 classes as spam and not spam. A classifier utilizes some training data to understand how given input variables relate to the class. In this case, 
										known spam and non-spam emails have to be used as the training data. When the classifier is trained accurately, it can be used to detect an unknown email.
									</p>
									<p>
										Unlike regression where the target variable (i.e., the predicted value) belongs to a continuous distribution, in case of classification, the target variable 
										is discrete. It can only be one of the various target classes in a given problem.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project will use the Drug Classification data set available on Kaggle to demonstrate 7 different machine learning categorical models:

										Because the Drug Classification data set contains information on 4 different drugs, we will be using multi-label Classification. Multi-Label Classification – 
										As the name suggests, the prediction for a data instance can be more than 2 possible discrete outcomes. For example, when predicting the correct drug a patient 
										is taking, a given data instance representing a patient can belong to any one of the 4 classes.The target feature of the data set is Drug type and the feature 
										sets are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Levels, and Na to Potassium Levels. This project will focus on the 7 classification models listed above, exploratory
										data analysis and data visualizations can be also be found in the project files <a href="https://github.com/jsloan96/Classification_Project" target="_blank"> here.</a>.

										Data binning, is a data pre-processing method used to minimize the effects of small observation errors. The original data values are divided into small intervals known

										in the case of small datasets. We have 2 variables that require binning:

									<p>
										SMOTE or Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is an oversampling technique but SMOTE working differently than your typical oversampling.
									</p>
									<p>
										In a classic oversampling technique, the minority data is duplicated from the minority data population. While it increases the number of data, 
										it does not give any new information or variation to the machine learning model.
									</p>
									<p>
										SMOTE works by utilizing a k-nearest neighbor algorithm to create synthetic data. SMOTE first start by choosing random data from the minority class, 
										then k-nearest neighbors from the data are set. Synthetic data would then be made between the random data and the randomly selected k-nearest neighbor. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Balancing the data using the SMOTE technique can be accomplished by using importing the SMOTE library from the imblearn package.

												This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates the probability 
												of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based on a given data set of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable 
												is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logit transformation is applied on the odds—that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of 
												failure. This is also commonly known as the log odds, or the natural logarithm of odds.

											</p>
											<p>
												In the distance-weighted nearest neighbor algorithm, it weights the contribution of each of the k neighbors according to their distance using the following query giving greater weight to the closest neighbors.

											<h5 class="mt-20 mb-20">Naive Bayes</h5>
											<p>
												Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier inspired by the Bayes theorem under a simple assumption which is the attributes are conditionally independent.The classification is conducted 
												by deriving the maximum posterior which is the maximal P(Ci|X) with the above assumption applying to Bayes theorem. This assumption greatly reduces the computational cost by only counting 
												the class distribution. Even though the assumption is not valid in most cases since the attributes are dependent, surprisingly Naive Bayes has able to perform impressively.
											</p>
											<p>
												Naive Bayes is a very simple algorithm to implement and good results have obtained in most cases. It can be easily scalable to larger datasets since it takes linear time, rather than by 
												expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers. Naive Bayes can suffer from a problem called the zero probability problem. When the conditional probability 
												is zero for a particular attribute, it fails to give a valid prediction. This needs to be fixed explicitly using a Laplacian estimator.

											<h5 class="mt-20 mb-20">K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</h5>
											<p>
												K-Nearest Neighbor is a lazy learning algorithm which stores all instances correspond to training data points in n-dimensional space. When an unknown discrete data is received, 
												it analyzes the closest k number of instances saved (nearest neighbors)and returns the most common class as the prediction and for real-valued data it returns the mean of k nearest neighbors.
											</p>
											<p>
												In the distance-weighted nearest neighbor algorithm, it weights the contribution of each of the k neighbors according to their distance using the following query giving greater weight to the closest neighbors.
												Usually KNN is robust to noisy data since it is averaging the k-nearest neighbors.
